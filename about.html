            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I belong to farmer class family. My family was too small just me my father and my younger sister my sister is 6 years younger than me and my father was a politician.  Since childhood I want to became an Army officer and I used to play many sports to remain fit parallel to my studies but due to my date of birth I was not eligible for it so I dropped my plan and choose engineering for that I took admission in hostel were they give special coaching for all the competitive exams.</p>
            <h2>Work & Skills </h2>
            <p>I work in John Thompson Racing stable I enjoy working here because I love horses and interested in racing as well. Everyone can't get here job easily because it is very risky work we hire only experienced staff unless we have an emergency. Why it is so risky horses are afraid of almost everything whenever they hear any sound or they realise any danger they start jumping that is dangerous for rider and the people standing nearby newly hire staff have more chances of getting injured older ones can easily handle the crazy horses. How I enrolled in this field? It's my luck Gai waterhouse is needs staff urgently and someone recommend my name for this job And they gave me Horses on the first day of my job. I became friendly with everyone after that I enrolled my friends in it they became riders and I want to be a rider as well I talked to higher authorities and they all agreed but our foreman became upset why I directly go to higher authorities instead of him and he don't want me to become rider he stated giving me hard work and used to shout on me for no reason so I have to change my work place.  </p>
            <p>I work for CRUST pizza as well as a delivery guy I found the best environment to work here. This work is very easy and there is no pressure of anything. There are many benefits of working here for me such as I finish at 9pm and get proper rest make me easy to wake up early for another job before CRUST I used to work in VITALY their I finish at 11pm and work is so hard I reach home very tired still getting less paid everyone in VITALY are very rude.</p>

            <h2> Education and knowledge </h2>
            <p>I am a student of Bachelor of Digital Media in Macleay college and my 3rd semester is going on. I am enjoying my studies and I have completed my 10 th class from local convent school as a day scholar but after that my parents puts me in hostel for the preparation of competitive exams I was interested in engineering in computer science and I tried my best to get admission in IIT the best government college of India but unfortunately I was getting admission in mechanical instead of  computer science so at last I have 2 options first take admission in mechanical engineering and second come to Australia for further education. I choose the second one.</p>
