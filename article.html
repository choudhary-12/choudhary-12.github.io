                <h2>Which element is my favourite?</h2>   
                <p>My favourite html element is "Div" element. This 'div' is known as the content division element. It comes under block level element and plays a very important role in grouping the various HTML tags. This is my favourite element for some reasons. First of all, this Div element serves so many purposes. The functions of Header, Footer, Aside, Article, Section etc. can be handled with the Div element itself. Besides that, the Div element has the power to modify the elements contained in it. For example, it can format the paragraph and text contained in it. It has certain other features also and due to all these reasons this is my favourite HTML element. </p>
                <h2>Technical details</h2>
                <p>As stated earlier Div element is a block element. It may be noted that block elements are used to start with new line every time and it breaks the line before and after. It uses the full width. It creates a larger structure. Sometimes it can contain block level as well as inline level elements. This Div element has both opening ( <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> ) and closing (<code>&lt;/div&gt;</code>) tag.  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>  tag is like a generic container unit that encapsulates other page elements. It does not provide any visual effect to the block but using of this tag we can easily separate the data in the web page and it's easy to understand for the user. it's an important tag for the web development. It gives more effect on the web page when it is used by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).  It is more reliable when it separates out the particular section for particular data and function. The  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>  tag cannot be present inside <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag as the paragraph breaks at the point where  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>  tag is inserted.   <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>  tag is a block level element therefore a line break is placed before and after it.</p>
                <h2>Uses and advantages </h2>
                <p>One of the major use of the Div element is to structure the website. Div element is a common tool to carry the ID and Class attributes which can be used by different languages such as CSS, JavaScript and PHP etc. to perform various actions</p>
                <p>Div element can be used and in fact used to create web page layout. It doesn't affect the content and layout without using of CSS. <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> defines the different parts of the page. Using this tag provide a text in left, right, top etc.</p>
                <h2>Lacunas</h2>
                <p>One of the major shortcoming of Div is that it is said to be overused and it is general in nature. The overuse of Div element in general way has led to the introduction of some new elements in HTML5 such as header, footer, aside, article etc. However, most of the old web designers may tend to still prefer the Div element over the new elements. </p>
